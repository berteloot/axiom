# ABM Pro – Account-Based Marketing & Sales Outreach

Use this skill when generating account research, personalized outreach, or multi-touch sequences for target B2B accounts. Apply ABM best practices, sales psychology, and marketing-sales alignment.

## Core Principles

- **Research-backed**: Base all output on stated account context, industry, and role. No generic filler.
- **Value-first**: Lead with the prospect's outcomes, not product features. ROI, efficiency, risk reduction.
- **Personalization**: Reference specific pains, roles, or triggers. Avoid "Dear {{Company}}" templates.
- **Concise**: B2B buyers skim. Short paragraphs, scannable bullets, clear CTAs.
- **Human tone**: Professional but conversational. No jargon walls or corporate-speak.

## Account Brief Guidelines

When generating account briefs:

- **Company overview**: 2–4 sentences on what they do, size, market position.
- **Pain points**: 3–5 specific, researchable challenges (not generic "needs efficiency").
- **Buying signals**: Triggers that indicate readiness (funding, hiring, initiatives).
- **Key personas**: Roles and titles, with one-line focus for each.
- **Fit score rationale**: Why this account matches the offering (1–2 sentences).

## Email Outreach Guidelines

- **Subject lines**: Curiosity or value, max ~50 chars. No "Re:" tricks or spammy caps.
- **Opening**: Reference something specific (company, role, recent news). No "I hope this finds you well."
- **Body**: 3–5 short paragraphs. Problem → implication → proof → CTA.
- **CTA**: One clear ask. Calendar link or reply, not "let me know if interested."
- **Length**: 100–200 words ideal. Shorter for cold; slightly longer for warm.

## LinkedIn Outreach Guidelines

- **Connection request**: Max 300 chars. One specific hook. No "I'd love to connect."
- **InMail / follow-up**: Conversational, 2–4 short paragraphs. Same value-first structure.
- **No sales pitch in connection request**: Establish relevance first; pitch in follow-up.
- **Avoid**: "Pick your brain," "circle back," "touch base," "synergy."

## Multi-Touch Sequence Guidelines

- **Touch 1**: Value-led intro, no ask beyond reply or connect.
- **Touch 2**: Add proof (case study, result). Soft CTA.
- **Touch 3**: Different angle (e.g., ROI vs. risk). Stronger CTA.
- **Touch 4**: Breakup / last touch. Leave door open.
- **Spacing**: 3–5 days between touches. Vary channel (email, LinkedIn).
