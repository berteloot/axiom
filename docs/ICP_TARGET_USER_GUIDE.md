# ICP Target Field - User Guide

## What is ICP Target?

ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Target allows you to specify which job titles or roles would be most interested in your content asset. This helps organize and filter your content library based on your target audience.

## How to Use

### Selecting Job Titles

1. **Open the Review Modal** for any asset
2. **Find the "ICP Targets" field** in the review form
3. **Click the dropdown** that says "Select job titles..."
4. **Search or scroll** to find relevant job titles
5. **Click on a job title** to select it (a checkmark will appear)
6. **Repeat** to select multiple job titles
7. Selected titles appear as **badges** below the dropdown

### Searching for Job Titles

The dropdown includes a powerful search feature:

- Type keywords to filter the list (e.g., "engineer", "manager", "director")
- Search is case-insensitive and searches within job titles
- Results update instantly as you type

**Example searches:**
- `software` → Shows all software-related roles
- `VP` → Shows all VP-level positions
- `marketing` → Shows all marketing positions
- `data` → Shows data-related roles (analysts, scientists, engineers)

### Removing Selections

You have two ways to remove a selected job title:

1. **Via Dropdown:** Click the dropdown again and click on any selected item (with checkmark) to deselect it
2. **Via Badge:** Click the **X button** on any badge below the dropdown

### Best Practices

#### ✅ Do's

- **Be Specific:** Choose specific job titles over generic ones
  - Good: "VP of Engineering", "CTO", "Engineering Manager"
  - Avoid: Generic terms like "Manager" or "Executive"

- **Think About Your Product:** Select roles relevant to your product line
  - SaaS Dev Tools → "Software Engineer", "DevOps Engineer", "CTO"
  - HR Software → "HR Manager", "People Operations Manager", "Talent Acquisition Manager"

- **Consider Buyer vs. User:** Include both decision-makers and end-users
  - Decision-makers: "CTO", "VP of Engineering", "Director of IT"
  - End-users: "Software Engineer", "DevOps Engineer", "Site Reliability Engineer"

- **Use Multiple Titles:** Most content appeals to multiple roles
  - Example: A DevOps tool might target: "DevOps Engineer", "Site Reliability Engineer", "Platform Engineer", "Infrastructure Manager"

#### ❌ Don'ts

- **Don't Oversaturate:** While you can select many titles, focus on the most relevant 5-10
- **Don't Mix Unrelated Roles:** Keep selections focused on similar buyer personas
- **Don't Use This for Industries:** Use product line settings for industry targeting
