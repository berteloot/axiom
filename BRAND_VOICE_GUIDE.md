# Brand Voice Guide

## Overview

Brand Voice has been updated to use a **multi-select menu** with predefined, industry-standard options. This ensures consistency and makes it easier to define your company's personality.

---

## Why Multi-Select?

Instead of free-text entry, you can now select multiple attributes that combine to define your brand:

**Example:**
- A fintech startup might choose: `Professional` + `Innovative` + `Trustworthy`
- A creative agency might choose: `Playful` + `Bold` + `Creative`
- An enterprise SaaS might choose: `Authoritative` + `Data-Driven` + `Customer-Centric`
